### Vector Visualisation ###

Simple little tool that lets you explore transforming a grid and vector in 2d space using a matrix.

Some transformations are very simple, but it easily gets complex quickly.

The input fields can take a formula or a constant. Just put expressions like math.sin, math.pow, etc.

To install:
pip install glfw PyOpenGL numpy
